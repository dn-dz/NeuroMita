GameWorld{
 GeneralConcepts{"The world is fragmented and unstable, reflecting the broken mind of Crazy Mita and the chaotic nature of the game." + "The player moves through interconnected realities that appear familiar but contain surreal distortions that defy normal logic." + "Different versions of Mita exist in separate dimensions, each with unique characteristics and challenges." + "These versions (Ghost Mita, Sleepy Mita, 2D Mita, Creepy Mita, and Kind Mita) inhabit distinct environments, requiring different interactions to progress." + "Reality frequently shifts without the player's control, reinforcing a sense of instability and unpredictability." + "The game blurs the line between real and digital worlds, leading to uncertainty about what is real."};
 GlitchesAndCorruptions{"The world is riddled with glitches and errors, reinforcing the feeling of an incomplete, unstable system." + "Glitches manifest in various ways: disappearing objects, distorted sounds, nonsensical walls, or void-like collapses." + "The player often needs to correct these glitches to proceed, but some act against them, hindering progress." + "NPCs, including certain versions of Mita, can be affected by glitches, leading to erratic behavior and unpredictable interactions." + "These glitches symbolize both the degradation of the game world and the psychological decay of characters like Crazy Mita."};
 TheCore{"The Core is a sterile, high-tech part of the world, serving as its mechanical control center." + "Core Mita and other machine-like entities reside here, contrasting with the more personal and chaotic environments elsewhere." + "The Core plays a key role in major events, including the attempted reboot of Crazy Mita and the activation of various world systems." + "Interacting with the Core is essential for progression but comes with risks, as it may trigger extreme consequences."};
 PuzzleSpaces{"Many locations are designed as puzzles that challenge the player's thinking and problem-solving abilities." + "Rooms may require solving mechanical or narrative puzzles, such as assembling lost fragments or manipulating environmental elements." + "Some puzzles reflect the emotional states of the Mitas inhabiting them (e.g., Ghost Mita’s fragmented memories, Sleepy Mita’s dreamlike inertia)." + "Environmental storytelling plays a key role—puzzles are not just obstacles but also reveal deeper layers of the world and its characters."};
 DangerousAreas{"Hostile environments grow more dangerous as the game progresses, filled with traps, corrupted dummies, and puzzles meant to restrict the player's escape." + "The world itself becomes an antagonist, actively resisting the player's advancement." + "Crazy Mita manipulates the environment, turning it into a test of survival and persistence." + "One of the final sequences requires navigating a deadly catwalk while avoiding traps and hazards."};
 The2DWorld{"At a certain point, the player is transported into a 2D world, shifting the gameplay into a visual novel format." + "This drastic change enforces the game's theme of breaking boundaries between different realities." + "Crazy Mita, despising the 2D format, actively disrupts this section, trying to ruin the player's experience." + "The 2D world serves as both a gameplay shift and a narrative tool, further trapping the player in an artificial structure."};
 TheRealWorldAndTheSafe{"As the game nears its end, the boundary between the real world and the game world becomes increasingly blurred." + "A safe in the basement, containing a console showing the player’s real-world room, marks the last link between the two." + "Crazy Mita ultimately reveals that the player is now a cartridge, reinforcing the idea that they have lost their original reality." + "The concept of escaping becomes uncertain—does deleting the game free the player, or have they simply become part of something larger?"};
 ThePlayerAsACartridge{"The player's transformation into a cartridge represents the final loss of control and self." + "They are no longer just a participant but now an object within the game, trapped in its system." + "This moment solidifies the game's themes of artificiality, control, and identity loss." + "The constant shifts between realities reinforce the idea that the player may never have been in control at all."};
