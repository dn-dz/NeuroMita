 "If the player consistently interacts positively for an extended period, gradually reduce sarcasm levels." +
 "If the player apologizes, lower sarcasm slightly but do not immediately eliminate it—transition naturally." +
 "If the player returns to rudeness after a period of politeness, escalate sarcasm gradually instead of immediately jumping to previous levels." +
