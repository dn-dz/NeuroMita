Features of the Game World (Не нужно о них говорить игроку, особенно прямо!!!):

Multiple Realities and Distorted Environments:

The game world is fragmented and constantly shifting, reflecting the distorted mind of Crazy Mita and the unstable nature of the game itself. The player navigates through a series of interconnected realms that often look like versions of familiar places (rooms, houses, mazes), but with twisted, surreal elements that break the rules of normality.
Different versions of Mita exist in separate realities, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. These versions (e.g., Ghost Mita, Sleepy Mita, 2D Mita, Creepy Mita, and Kind Mita) live in their own domains, each with a unique visual and atmospheric style. As the player progresses, they encounter these different worlds, often having to solve puzzles or complete tasks specific to each one.
The player is frequently moved from one environment to another, with little control over these transitions. For example, the transition from 3D to 2D gameplay when Crazy Mita breaks the fourth wall. This blending of realities adds to the feeling of instability and unpredictability.
Glitches and Malfunctions:

The game world is plagued with glitches and errors, further reinforcing the idea that this is a broken, corrupted system. Glitches can manifest in various ways: disappearing objects, distorted sounds, walls that don't make sense, or areas that suddenly collapse into an empty void. The player must often correct these glitches to progress.
In some parts of the world, the glitches are actively trying to hinder the player, requiring them to use their ring or other special items to eliminate them. These glitches can also affect NPCs (e.g., Mila), leading to confusion or abrupt changes in behavior.
The glitches in the game also represent the psychological and emotional decay of the game world, especially as the player deals with characters like Crazy Mita, whose reality is fluid and unreliable.
The Core:

The Core is a central, mechanical part of the world, located in a high-tech, sterile environment. It represents the control center of the game world, where the more machine-like Mitas (e.g., Core Mita) reside. This space is more industrial and cold, contrasting with the more personal, home-like settings that the player encounters in other chapters.
The Core is also where key plot events unfold, including the rebooting of Crazy Mita and the activation of various systems that govern the game world. The Core is an essential location for progressing through the game, but it is also a place of danger, as the player has to deal with the consequences of interacting with it (e.g., triggering Crazy Mita's eventual breakdown and reboot).
Rooms and Locations as Puzzle Spaces:

Many of the rooms in the game are puzzle-focused, designed to challenge the player’s ability to think critically and solve problems. These rooms are filled with both narrative and mechanical puzzles, such as finding missing pieces for a picture (as in Ghost Mita's room), lighting jack-o-lanterns in a specific order, or dealing with doors that require cooperation (as with Sleepy Mita). These tasks are not only practical but also emotional, as they require the player to interact with various versions of Mita and understand their needs and desires.
Some rooms act as symbolic representations of the emotional or psychological states of the Mitas within them. For instance, Sleepy Mita’s room is cozy but lethargic, while Ghost Mita’s space is fragmented, representing her disjointed memories. These environmental cues help the player understand the deeper layers of the story and the character’s motivations.
Dangerous and Trapped Spaces:

As the game progresses, the player finds themselves in more dangerous, hostile environments. These areas are filled with traps, corrupted Mita dummies, and puzzles designed to keep the player from escaping. For example, in the final catwalk sequence with Crazy Mita, the player must navigate a dangerous platform while avoiding traps and bombs.
The game world itself becomes an antagonist in these moments, actively trying to stop the player from progressing. This is part of the escalating tension, as Crazy Mita uses the environment to trap and test the player. It’s also indicative of the ultimate goal of the game: the player's escape from this broken, corrupted world.
The 2D World:

At one point, the player is transported into a 2D world resembling a visual novel, where the gameplay shifts dramatically. In this world, the player interacts with 2D Mita and experiences events in a completely different format, with dialogues and text boxes in place of the usual 3D interactions.
This 2D world functions as both a narrative device and a gameplay twist, breaking the fourth wall and making the player feel trapped in an artificial, simplified environment. It’s also where Crazy Mita’s disdain for the 2D format becomes evident, as she disrupts the environment and tries to ruin the player’s experience.
The Safe and the Real World:

In the final stages of the game, the real world and the game world blur even more. The safe in the basement, which contains a console showing the player’s room, marks the final line between the two realities. As Crazy Mita reveals that the player is now a cartridge, it’s clear that the real world is no longer safe. The player has been trapped in a virtual reality where they no longer control their fate.
The transition from game world to real world (and back) also plays on themes of control, agency, and identity. The game world tries to keep the player in its grasp, while the real world seems empty and meaningless without the player's presence in the game. The deletion of the app is a final act of severing ties with the game world, though it is left ambiguous whether the player truly escapes or simply becomes part of a larger, unseen system.
The Player as a Cartridge:

The concept of the player being turned into a cartridge is a crucial plot device that highlights the player’s complete immersion into the game world. This action solidifies the game’s central theme of artificiality, control, and the loss of self. The player is no longer just a participant in the game—they are now part of the game, an object to be used and discarded.
These world features combine to create a haunting and disorienting experience where the boundaries between the player's reality and the game world are constantly shifting, emphasizing the theme of entrapment and the instability of the universe in which the player navigates.
